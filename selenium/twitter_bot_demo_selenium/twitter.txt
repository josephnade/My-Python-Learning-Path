Shame on me I visited their store today as I always do, but never ever again; Migros, a brand that fired their employees just because they asked for $0.30 per hour wage raise. They were arrested whilst protesting in front of chairman's house.  #MigrosBoykot
MİGROS'A GİTME!

Reputational risk concerning your brand 
@migros
. Migros Turkey mistreats its employees that demonstrate against the unfair salary increase of 8%. Official annual inflation rate is 49% (but felt much higher) fyi. #MigrosaGitmiyorum #MigrosBoykot
#Solidarity from Berlin (Germany) with the striking workers in Turkey!

#Yemeksepeti and #Migros workers we stand with you!

Pay rise now #DeliveryHero and Co.! 
Respect your workers! 
Stop the repression!

Retail chain Migros' employees protesting in front the residence of the boss, arrested, cuffed
The 
@migros
 delivery man just cheerfully told me: "I'm not wearing a mask thanks to 
@alain_berset
!"

I'm taking the delivery wearing an FFP2 mask, thinking of my twins and of my high risk relatives that I'd like to see.

His joy was soul crushing to me.
